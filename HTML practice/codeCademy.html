      <h2>HTML Structure</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. As you
        saw in the last exercise, we placed
        <code><mark>&lt;p&gt;</mark></code> tags within
        <code><mark>&lt;body&gt;</mark></code> tags. When an element is
        contained inside another element, it is considered the <em>child</em> of
        that element. The child element is said to be <em>nested</em> inside of
        the <em>parent</em> element.
      </p>
      <div class="html-codes">
        <code>
          <pre>
          &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is a child of the body&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
        </pre
          >
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        In the example above, the <code><mark>&lt;p&gt;</mark></code> element is
        nested inside the <code><mark>&lt;body&gt;</mark></code> element. The
        <code><mark>&lt;p&gt;</mark></code> element is considered a child of the
        <code><mark>&lt;body&gt;</mark></code> element, and the
        <code><mark>&lt;body&gt;</mark></code> element is considered the parent.
        You can also see that we’ve added two spaces of indentation (using the
        <span class="keys"><mark>space</mark></span> bar) for better
        readability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be
        extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The
        relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements
        is known as <em>hierarchy</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s consider a more complicated example that uses some new tags:</p>
      <div class="html-codes">
        <code>
          <pre>
          &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;Sibling to p, but also grandchild of body&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Sibling to h1, but also grandchild of body&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/body&gt;
        </pre
          >
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        In this example, the <code><mark>&lt;body&gt;</mark></code> element is
        the parent of the <code><mark>&lt;div&gt;</mark></code> element. Both
        the <code><mark>&lt;h1&gt;</mark></code> and
        <code><mark>&lt;p&gt;</mark></code> elements are children of the
        <code><mark>&lt;div&gt;</mark></code> element. Because the
        <code><mark>&lt;h1&gt;</mark></code> and
        <code><mark>&lt;p&gt;</mark></code> elements are at the same level, they
        are considered siblings and are both grandchildren of the
        <code><mark>&lt;body&gt;</mark></code> element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can
        inherit behavior and styling from their parent element. You’ll learn
        more about webpage hierarchy when you start digging into CSS.

    </div>

    <div id="html-headings">
      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>
        Headings in HTML are similar to headings in other types of media. For
        example, in newspapers, large headings are typically used to capture a
        reader’s attention. Other times, headings are used to describe content,
        like the title of a movie or an educational article.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML follows a similar pattern. In HTML, there are six different
        <em>headings</em>, or <em>heading elements</em>.
        <a
          href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/headings?page_ref=catalog"
          target="_blank"
          >Headings
        </a>
        can be used for a variety of purposes, like titling sections,
        articles,or other forms of content.
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
